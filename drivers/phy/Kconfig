	  PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices. PHY devices are dedicated hardware that handle the physical
	  layer of the protocols in the OSI model.
	  PHYs are commonly used for high speed interfaces such as Serial-ATA
	  or PCI express.
	  The API provides functions to initialize/deinitialize the
	  PHY, power on/off the PHY, and reset the PHY. It's meant to be as
	  compatible as possible with the equivalent framework found in the
	  linux kernel.
