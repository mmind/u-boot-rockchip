U-Boot for Qnap TS233 Devices
=============================

This allows U-Boot to boot the Qnap TS233 NAS

The device is similar to the TS433 in terms of its basic peripheral setup
of SoC, DDR, EMMC, 3 USB-ports, 1G network interface, SoC-SATA ports,
serial and maskrom access.

Please follow the TS433 steps but with the following changes.

Building U-Boot
---------------

The TS233 can just run the TS433 U-Boot binary, but if a separate binary
should be build, the following command will do so:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
    $ export ROCKCHIP_TPL=../rkbin/bin/rk35/rk3568_ddr_1560MHz_v1.23.bin
    $ make qnap-ts233-rk3568_defconfig
    $ make

This will build ``u-boot-rockchip.bin`` which can be written to the
on-board eMMC.

Image installation
------------------

The serial port is located next to the CPU and labeled "SOC_UART", while
the maskrom jumper header is located in the smaller cutout and
labeled "MASKROM RECOVERY".

The USB port to use is the one located in the front of the device.
